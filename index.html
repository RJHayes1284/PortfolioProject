      <h3>Here's the Basics</h3>
      <section>
        <h3>Hello, my name is Rebekah Hayes.</h3>
        <p>I'm a software developer from Dayton, Texas.</p>
        <p>
          If I'm not able to connect with someone through coding than I have the
          following opportunities to find common ground:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>I'm 29 years old</li>
          <li>A wife</li>
          <li>A mother</li>
          <li>Native Texan</li>
          <li>United States Marine Veteran</li>
          <li>An avid Astros fan</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As a Marine Corps Veteran I am well versed in problem solving,
          adapting when things go wrong, and being a contributing member of a
          successful team.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for words extends beyond my love of coding into a love of
          simply writing. I'm also a novice fiction writer so when I'm not
          working or spending time with family I'm writing or reading something.
        </p>

        <h3>Introducing Rebekah</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated high school not sure what I wanted to do for the rest of
          my life. So I joined the Marine Corps and spent four years serving my
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016 I finished my tour in the Marines and ended up entering the
          world of customer service in both the retail world and most recently
          in an insurance agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt called to a more challenging career though, something more
          fulfilling that will also better allow me to provide for my family so
          I began my adventure into the world of software development.
